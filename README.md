# KCL Tech Android Series
Welcome to KCL Tech Soc Android Series. We'll be learning Android from scratch and building up to create a basic Android application that makes a call to an API, returns data and displays it in a memory friendly format.

## Schedule
* Lecture 1 - Android Building Blocks - Resources and App Components
* Lecture 2 - Events and Intents
* Lecture 3 - UI: Views and ViewGroups
* Lecture 4 - Basic Android Threading
* Lecture 5 - Using APIs
* Lecture 6 - Review/You Decide!
* Lecture 7 to 9 - Final Project

## General Information
There's no need to sign up - just show up on Monday, 18:30-20:30, in BH(S)2.01. You don't need prior knowledge but we'll be building up our skillset each week so it's advised you come to every session!

Since 9 weeks isn't a lot of time, the focus will be on practical work. I'll be using the Android Developer website as the primary reference and **I encourage you to use it too**. You'll learn the most by trying things out yourself!
